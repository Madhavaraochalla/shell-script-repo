## üöÄ How to Use the Scripts

### üîπ 1. Clone This Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Madhavaraochalla/shell-script-repo.git
cd shell-script-repo

# Your GitHub username and repo name
GITHUB_USER=""<Your user name>
REPO_NAME="" <Repo-name>

# Files to commit (Ensure these are valid files in the current directory)
FILES=("") file to commit


# Files to remove (if needed)
FILES_TO_REMOVE=("") files remove from github

Pass token
export GITHUB_TOKEN=****************

to run script
./File-name


Usage  

Normal run (actually does everything):

    ./your-script.sh


Dry-run mode (only shows what it would do):

    ./your-script.sh --dry-run 



What‚Äôs happening in the script:

The script adds files that you‚Äôve listed in the FILES array (e.g., delete-repo.sh, create-users.sh, etc.). This part is done with:


for file in "${FILES[@]}"; do
    if [ -f "$file" ]; then
        if ! $DRYRUN; then
            git add "$file"
        fi
        echo "Added $file"
    else
        echo "Warning: $file does not exist."
    fi
done
You also have an optional git add . command (which can add all files), but it's commented out by default, like this:

### Optional: Stage all local changes (Uncomment the below line if you want to add all files)
# $DRYRUN || git add .


When ever using git add. comment this line first then only git add . works 

# Files to commit
FILES=("delete-repo.sh" "create-users.sh" "deploy-grafana.sh" "Push-code.sh" "delete.sh" "deploy.sh" "Readme.md")
